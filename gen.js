        "description": "★ Scratch in Scratch - (Fixed after 4 years!)\nVisit: www.youtube.com/griffpatch for tutorials\n\n✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦\nCLICK THE REAL GREEN FLAG AGAIN TO\nRUN THE PROJECT 'IN' THE PROJECT :)\nClick it again again to stop it.\n✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦✧✦\n\nWho can create the most awesome project in this Scratch Emulator? Today's featured project is an idea i'm proposing for Scratch 3... although of course it doesn't have to be done like this, but it's one possible way to draw a polygon & text\n\nRemix it, create a script in the project and then save the remix to keep your script in place or save them here: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/205407/ - I can then check out your projects to see how things are going! In time I might start including example projects for people to see.\n\n━ How to use ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n★ Create Scripts to dragging blocks off the side panel\n★ Rename variables by clicking on them\n★ Delete blocks by dragging them onto the side panel\n★ Scroll up and down using the arrow keys or mouse scroll wheel\n★ Left & Right arrow keys to scroll left and right\n★ Duplicate a block stack by holding down alt before dragging.\n★ RUN THE PROJECT by clicking the green flag again, or clicking the green flag hat block of your script.\n\n━ What works? ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nA lot of blocks have now been implemented in the runtime. Any block you see in the palette should work (I've removed the ones that don't for now). Loops & broadcasts are implemented including ones that wait on other events occurring before proceeding. I've built in looping execution lock up prevention and you will find that you are able to use instructions like ask or wait even within an execution block that is set to run without refresh - yay :). You will note I've added a block that doesn't exist in Scratch, the run without screen refresh block. This block to fill the gap left by not having implemented custom blocks at present.\n\n━ Why do this??? ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSo, why do this? I guess \"because we can!\". Wasn't that the excuse for going to the moon after all? I'm not sure if this will be useful, but I can already think of a few ideas - Can you? (If you do then let me know!) This is still early days for the project as it was only started on the 8th June, but you can already do far more than I was originally aiming for. It was going to be a simple block layout project, but I've already extended build scripts and now even run them! Crazy :)\n\n━ Update Log ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n14 Jan 2023 - v0.23.3 - FIxed loading of \"Pen Loading\"\n13 Jan 2023 - v0.23.0 - Drag background to scroll\n12 Jan 2023 - v0.22.0 - Fixed for Scratch 3 (at last)\n27 Jun 2016 - v0.21.1 - Another new block in pen to write text to the canvas - Another one I'd love to see in Scratch 3 :) + Left & Right arrow keys to scroll left & right.\n25 Jun 2016 - v0.20.0 - Added a new block that I would really want in Scratch 3 - The pen up and fill block to draw polygons. I've used @TheLogFather's triangle drawer and I support up to 4 sides convex shapes only.\n24 Jun 2016 - v0.19.1 - Fix threading to allow all to run at least once\n24 Jun 2016 - v0.19.0 - Added example projects to the 'load' option.\n23 Jun 2016 - v0.18.0 - Added wait until <> block.\n23 Jun 2016 - v0.17.0 - Rebalanced thread timings to account for active/inactive threads. Improved var, list & event picklist setup. Added list reporter.\n22 Jun 2016 - v0.16.1 - New / Save / Load features.\n21 Jun 2016 - v0.15.1 - Tidied sidebar palette (corrected order) scroll wheel now also scrolls the sidebar palette.\n20 Jun 2016 - v0.14.3 - Implemented dirty region clip rendering for faster dragging, plus correct pick lists at last (That was tricky!)\n17 Jun 2016 - v0.13.0 - 'run without screen refresh' block.\n16 Jun 2016 - v0.12.0 - Added broadcasts, plus sensing blocks\n16 Jun 2016 - v0.11.2 - Fixed bug in repeat until\n16 Jun 2016 - v0.11.0 - Added support for lists\n15 Jun 2016 - v0.10.0 - Implemented thread yielding.\n15 Jun 2016 - v0.9.2 - Implemented move motion blocks & pen.\n14 Jun 2016 - v0.9 - Use the scroll wheel or up down cursor keys to scroll. Hold down alt while dragging a block to duplicate stack...\n14 Jun 2016 - v0.8 - Fixed corruption when dragging + new blocks\n13 Jun 2016 - v0.7 - Added a small amount of execution support.\n12 Jun 2016 - v0.5 - Added block schema and sidebar palette\n10 Jun 2016 - v0.4 - Added mouse drag and drop\n9 Jun 2016 - v0.2 - Added Nested IF block and <> characters\n9 Jun 2016 - v0.1 - Initial Taster Release",

This is a work in progress level, not yet complete so it may feel a little abrupt. Still, I need to test how it is working so far! So here goes :D - Jump on board and see how many players we get on this thing before it breaks lol.\n\nRun the course - collect the flags, and then make it back to the beginning to collect the final flag to get your time.\n\nIf you see a yellow player... It's me guys :D\nThe rainbow player is the fastest player right now who is playing. Their name is shown at the top of the screen.\n\n*** CONTROLS ***\n* Use arrow keys or WASD to control the player\n* Z is alternative crouch, SPACE alternative jump\n* Press 'N' to show all players names\n* Hold E or R to open Emoji panels\n* Complete the speed run and back to the start will report your time and reward you with a parachute - use space to use it :)\n* Mouse over a player to see their individual name\n* Q + R to reset level for speed runs\n\n*** SPECIAL MOVES ***\nHigh Jump - Hold down then Up\nLong Jump - Run then quickly press Down, then Up\nSlide - On a slope press Down and Left or Right\nWall Jump - Jump against a wall, then press Up again\n\nChangelog:\n15 July 2022 - Removed Name of fastest player (due to hackers *sob*)\n31 Mar 2022 - Updated cloud code\n9 Dec 2021 - Trying to add current fastest + Fixes for slope sliding\n7 Dec 2021 - Bugfix - Stop end of buffer making players appear under level.\n6 Dec 2021 - Initial Release v1.0\n\nCredits:\nEmoji - Openmoji\nMusic - Twenty Six 0 Eight by Tripledigit",

You can only be killed by the snakes as 'you' see them, but be aware that due to network lag other snakes may appear to not be killed by you because on their screens they may be just a little ahead of where you see them.\n\n★ Control your snake with the mouse.\n★ Collect the food to grow longer.\n★ Don't run into other snakes!\n★ Click or Space to dash (if you have eaten enough)\n\nPress 'L' to toggle lag mode (turns off all the effects)\nPress 'N' to toggle player names (helps reduce lag too)\n\n★★★ Credit ★★★\nAll credit to slither.io for the original game...  Also credit to @theChAOTiC for the basis of the font engine that I remixed.\n\n★★★ Change Log ★★★\n10 Jun 2022 - v1.13 - Enhanced game joining code | 5 new snake skins | Improved text rendering\n8 Jun 2022 - v1.12 - Increased Max Players to 10 | Chose better starting snake skins | Improved forward prediction of snakes | Reduced lag caused by large snakes | layered map on top of snakes | removed Herobrine\n7 Jun 2022 - v1.11 - Made invulnerable snakes be non-deadly for slightly longer than they are invulnerable to stop little snakes taking advantage\n14 Jun 2021 - Server 2\n23 Jun 2019 - Reshared with the release of my YouTube Series on Cloud Games!\n8 Jan 2019 - v1.10 - Experimental Improvements in face of unpredictable cloud data...\n24 Jun 2019 - reshared for screen cast\n3 Jan 2019 - v1.9 - Fixed for Scratch 3 Pen.\n22 Sep 2017 - v1.8 - Throttled Cloud Data send rate to try to get this working within the new cloud data limits.\n6 May 2016 - v0.1 - Initial Release",

If you are ever unsure then just look below the project on this screen and look if it says \"Cloud Variables\" next to \"Video Sensing\". If not, then you are quite safe! If it does, then please be careful!\n\nCredit to @Geotale for pioneering the new binary partitioned scanning technique",

However, due to popular request, here are the completed scripts for episode 16 - No excuse now not to try to add Koopas by following episode 17:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UsBFARVXOIM\n\n★ Controls\nCursor keys / WASD to move\n\n★ Level Editor Keys\n0 (zero) to toggle level editor\n1-5 to switch tiles, E to pick tile under cursor\n9 to place enemies\nQ to Toggle auto tile arranging\nR to Reset the level\nL to Switch Levels (See levels 1-3)\n\n★ Special Note on Saving Levels\nTo save your level updates, you must exit the level editor with the 0 key again, and then look inside the project and go File / Save. This ensures your level is saved along with your scratch project!\n\n★ This is not a complete game by any means! You can learn from it, and we will continue to build it out in future episodes on YouTube!\n\n★ All sprites are from Nintendo's Super Mario Adv 4\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/485855713/\n\n★ Many more fun tutorials can be found on my channel!

END CREDITS PIANO PLAYER ******\n\nI really loved this piece of piano piece from when I first heard it as a child - It's the end credits from E.T. I'd love to be able to play it on the piano myself, but not being good enough I instead transcribed the sheet music into this new Scratch Project.\n\nThe built in Scratch piano didn't quite sound good enough, so I've imported the samples from a free piano virtual instrument (The SGPN sound-font). This involved mapping each of the 20 sound samples onto a selection of 3 to 5 possible piano notes. The results are pretty good :)\n\nThe treble clef and bass clefs each have their notes encoded in a list on their respective sprites. I typed them in my hand reading from the piano score, and they are in the format:\n\nC#4^12 - This means Play a C# in octave 4 with an accent (loud) for one 4th of a bar (48 is a full bar). I used 12 because then I can do triplets easier - Enjoy! This song is full of them.\n",
